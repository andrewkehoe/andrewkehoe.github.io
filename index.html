        <p>Greetings, I'm Andrew Kehoe, a software engineer that makes things nobody asked for.</p>
        <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and you can see the many, many repositories
            that have been made for that in its <a href="https://github.com/orgs/kehoa-csc/repositories">GitHub org</a>,
            if you're curious. It's given me a lot of Java experience.
        </p>
